# explorer BE GONE
So i made a what I guess you could call malware that deletes your explorer.exe off your Windows PC.

**YOU MUST BECAREFUL NOT TO RUN ON YOUR MAIN PC AS RECOVERING MAY BE HARD WITHOUT HAVING TO *REINSTALLING WINDOWS!!!***

The code needs to be ran as administrator in order to run the code.

I recommend running in a *Virtual Machine*.
